A Simple Sinatra setup
======================

* controller.rb is the controller
* models are found in the /models directory and are loaded up in the configure block of the controller.
* views are in the view directory, they use a layout.erb file and can handle partials

Steps
-------------
* install ruby, mysql and all required gems
* create a database
* define your models and properties
* run: $ ruby ./db/migrate.rb (this will create your tables)
* Note: db is defined in the configure block of controller.rb and the migration.rb file
* code!
* start the server with: $ ruby controller.rb
